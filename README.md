# MLIP Lab7 - Manage and Track Machine Learning Project with MLFlow
In this lab, you will explore how to manage and track Machine Learning Projects using MLFlow. Although MLFlow is helpful to model provenance in team project M3, you should use the personal machine to avoid multiple installations and environmental conflict..</br>
MLFLow is a powerful tool for MLops. It provides  </br>
The testing tool we use is [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/index.html). It is a light weight tool that collect test cases automatically. 
To receive credit for this lab, show your work to the TA during recitation.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Show correct configuration of a Jenkins pipeline on **forked [Lab6 Github Repo](https://github.com/JayYu0116/MLIP_Lab6/)**. The build process must automatically fetch Jenkinsfile and run pipeline according to it.
- [ ] Complete the `jenkinsfile` to make the Jenkins pipeline test the repo during each build. Explain your understanding of what the given Jenkinsfile does.
- [ ] Complete the `test_data_split` function in `test.py` to test data split step.
