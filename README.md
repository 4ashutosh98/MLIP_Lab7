# MLIP Lab7 - Manage and Track Machine Learning Project with MLFlow
In this lab, you will explore how to manage and track Machine Learning Projects using [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). Although MLFlow is helpful to team project M3, We recommend you to use the personal machine to avoid multiple installations and environmental conflict.</br></br>
MLFLow is a powerful tool that enables good practices aligned with MLOps principles. MLFlow can track experiment results during development for late comparison. It can perform version control on dataset and model and store versioned model objects to make your project reproducible and manageable.</br></br>
To receive credit for this lab, please show your all deliverables to the TA during recitation.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Show correct configuration of a Jenkins pipeline on **forked [Lab6 Github Repo](https://github.com/JayYu0116/MLIP_Lab6/)**. The build process must automatically fetch Jenkinsfile and run pipeline according to it.
- [ ] Complete the `jenkinsfile` to make the Jenkins pipeline test the repo during each build. Explain your understanding of what the given Jenkinsfile does.
- [ ] Complete the `test_data_split` function in `test.py` to test data split step.
